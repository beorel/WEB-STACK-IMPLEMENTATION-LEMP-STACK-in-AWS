### STEP 1 – INSTALLING THE NGINX WEB SERVER

In order to display web pages to our site visitors, we are going to employ Nginx, a high-performance web server. 

We’ll use the apt package manager to install this package.

Since this is our first time using apt for this session, start off by updating your server’s package index. 

Following that, you can use apt install to get Nginx installed:

```sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```
